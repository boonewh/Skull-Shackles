                <h2>Claiming the Island of Empty Eyes</h2>  
				<h3>August 31, 2024</h3>  
				<img src="images/phantasms.jpg" alt="Undead rise at night to wander a delapidated fort near the shore with a ship moored in the background" class="left">
				<p>After their triumphant victory in the Captain’s Regatta, the crew of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> sailed back to Port Peril. Their legend had already outpaced them, spreading through the taverns and streets like wildfire. Tales of their daring exploits echoed from every corner, and the officers found themselves the subject of countless songs and toasts. In every inn, tankards were raised in their honor, their drinks paid for by admirers and fellow captains. Their friends and allies congratulated them heartily, but it was the invitation to a feast hosted by the Pirate Council itself that truly marked their place in the Shackles' history.</p>  

				<p>As the celebration raged, the Master of the Gales pulled the officers aside. “Your prize,” he said, his voice low and serious, “is an island. North of the Rampore Isles, in a remote archipelago. It’s called the Island of Empty Eyes, named for the strange statues that stare out over its shores. The island is yours—but don’t expect it to be an easy conquest.” He glanced at each of them in turn, his eyes like ice. “There are dangers on that island. If you want to claim it and take your place on the Pirate Council, you’ll need to tame it. In three months’ time, the Council will visit to see if you’re fit for the honor. You’ll be expected to host them, as lords of the Shackles deserve. If you succeed, they’ll take your oath of loyalty and give you your seat on the Council. If not… you won’t be the first Regatta champion to fail.”</p>  

				<p>The officers of the <i>Bane</i> exchanged determined glances. They knew the legends of the Island of Empty Eyes. They would claim it—or die trying.</p>  

				<p>The very next morning, they set sail for their new domain. Arriving at the island, Varen scanned the coastline from the crow’s nest. After some discussion, they decided against the larger coves and guided the <i>Bane</i> into a small, protected bay in the southeast. The closer they got, the thicker the seaweed became, clogging the waters and emitting a strange, foul smell.</p>  

				<p>Suddenly, Kasmira’s voice rang out. “Treasure! I see something in the seaweed—looks like a chest!” She insisted they investigate, and soon the officers were in a small boat, rowing toward the suspicious object. As they neared, the seaweed itself erupted into life, lashing out with vine-like tendrils. Varen and Owlbear were caught in its writhing grasp, and Varen’s cutlass did little to free him.</p>  

				<p>Red’s axe barely scratched the creature, but Kasmira’s bullets tore through it. Varen, thinking quickly, phased out of the creature’s hold and reappeared with his musket. His shots ripped into the creature, and soon Kasmira and Varen’s combined firepower brought it down. The seaweed slumped into the water, dead—the “treasure” had been nothing more than a lure.</p>  

				<p>Undeterred, the officers rowed ashore and began exploring their new home. As they walked along the beach, they heard an ethereal singing drifting through the rocks. Following the sound, they came upon a grotto with crystal-clear water—and a woman, or rather, a fey, bathing within. She rose from the water, smiling warmly. Introducing herself as Sefina, she explained that she had made the island her home long ago and welcomed them as its new masters. Though wary, the crew found her to be genuine, and after some conversation, they bid her farewell, promising to speak again soon.</p>  

				<p>Continuing their exploration, they reached the largest cove, where a waterfall split the beach. On the far side, they spotted a dilapidated fort, its walls crumbling but still standing. Kasmira, eager to investigate, used her magic tricorne to conjure a boat, and the group set off across the waters.</p>  

				<p>Halfway across, disaster struck. Tentacles as thick as tree trunks burst from the depths—a massive octopus had been lurking below, waiting for prey. The creature’s limbs wrapped around the boat, lifting the officers into the air. Red quickly cast a spell to protect the group, while Kasmira fired her pistol into the writhing tentacles. Varen, his eyes glowing with dark energy, drained the life from the beast even as it pulled them into the water.</p>  

				<p>The octopus dragged Kasmira toward its massive maw, ready to bite down, but she pressed her pistol to its flesh and fired, the shot echoing through the water. The octopus shuddered, then went still, releasing its grip as it sank back into the depths. The crew, wet and bruised, hauled themselves back into the boat and continued toward the fort.</p>  

				<p>Entering through the shattered gates, they found the fort in ruins, but still salvageable. This could be their new home—if they could survive its dangers. Inside the first building, they were immediately struck by a wave of fear so intense that Owlbear fled in terror. The others, though shaken, held their ground as a dark, nightmarish figure emerged from the shadows.</p>  

				<p>They fought back, but their weapons did little to harm the creature. It wasn’t until Red cast a spell that solidified the swirling shadows that they were able to land any meaningful blows. With renewed vigor, they destroyed the creature, but it had cost them dearly.</p>  

				<p>Upstairs, the fort was riddled with traps. Each room they entered seemed more dangerous than the last. Finally, they reached a corner room, where a voice shouted from within. “Go away! Leave me alone!” Kasmira picked the lock and opened the door, revealing a man huddled in the top corner of the room—his back pressed against the ceiling. His eyes were wild with madness, and no amount of soothing words from Kasmira could calm him. At one point, he even screamed, “Get out of my head!” and triggered an electrical trap, nearly frying Kasmira.</p>  

				<p>Reluctant to harm the man, and with night falling, they decided to leave him be for now, hoping if they brought Sandara, she could heal his mind later. Red flew back to the ship to move it to the large cove, where they could anchor for the night.</p>  

				<p>That decision may have saved their lives. As darkness fell over the island, a thick mist rose from the ground. Lights appeared in the towers of the fort, casting an eerie glow over the courtyard. The crew watched in horror as undead figures began to shuffle through the fort, their rotting eyes turning toward the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i>. They walked into the water, glaring at the ship with malice, their decaying flesh hanging from their bones.</p>  

				<p>As the mist thickened and the dead crept ever closer, their hollow eyes gleaming with malice, one truth became chillingly clear—their island was not just dangerous. It was cursed. And the horrors that waited in the darkness were only beginning to stir.</p>

				<h2>The Ghosts of Empty Eyes</h2>  
				<h3>September 7, 2024</h3>  
				<img src="images/the_temple.jpg" alt="Nightmare creatures attack in the ruined temple." class="right">
				<p>The morning after a harrowing night of haunting visions and ghostly threats, the crew of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> steeled themselves to confront the madness they had left behind. They returned to the room where they had found Ederleigh Baines, once again navigating through the treacherous traps that had been reset. The unsettling sense of being watched weighed heavily on them as they made their way through the top floor, reaching the room where Baines had been hiding.</p>  

				<p>They found him just as they had left—raving, eyes wild with fear, clinging to the ceiling in the room's corner like a cornered animal. "Leave me alone! Get out of my head!" he screamed, his voice cracking. Finn attempted to fly up, hoping to bring Baines down so Sandara could attempt a healing spell, but Baines lashed out in panic, triggering another trap that blasted Finn with electricity. Varen, reacting swiftly, cast a spell that wove a web through the room, hoping to keep Baines in place. The magical strands caught the crazed man, and Finn managed to maneuver through the sticky threads to reach him.</p>  

				<p>With effort, Finn pinned Baines against the ceiling, but he couldn't drag him down alone. Varen cast a spell that enlarged Sandara, making her as large as a giant. With newfound strength, Sandara reached up, her hand gently touching Baines even as he flinched away. Her spell of healing coursed through him, and slowly, the madness in his eyes began to fade. He blinked, confused, his gaze shifting around the room as if seeing it for the first time. Kasmira spoke softly, drawing him back to reality and easing him down from his heightened state of fear.</p>  

				<p>Ederleigh finally began to speak, his voice trembling but coherent. He explained that he had come to the island with his master, Bikendi Otongu, a Mwangi wizard. The wizard had brought him and a pirate crew to the island to enact a ritual—something involving his soul passing into the realm of dreams. But before the ritual could be completed, Cyclopes attacked, killing the crew and seemingly Bikendi himself. Yet Baines knew his master’s spirit still haunted the island, tormenting him night after night, driving him to the brink of madness.</p>  

				<p>Kasmira asked if Baines would be willing to help them explore the island, to reclaim it from whatever horrors still lurked there. He agreed, on one condition—if they left, they would take him with them. He had no wish to stay on this cursed island a moment longer than necessary.</p>  

				<p>The group sent Ederleigh back to the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> with Sandara to begin his recovery while they pressed on, determined to explore the fort’s ruins. The next building appeared to be an old mess hall, but as they stepped inside, Kasmira suddenly heard a voice whisper in her mind. "Where is the dreamstone?" it demanded. "I don’t know what you are talking about," she answered aloud, glancing at her companions, her expression wary. "Where is the dreamstone? What have you done with it?" the voice persisted, more insistent.</p>  

				<p>Before she could answer again, three shadowy forms materialized, their bodies swirling like living nightmares. They resembled the dark creature they had faced the previous day, and their presence filled the air with a tangible sense of dread. Finn was immediately overcome by their fear magic, his eyes wide with terror as he turned and fled from the room.</p>  

				<p>Two of the creatures moved in on Kasmira and Red, while the third lingered behind, its eyes fixed on them with an unnatural hatred. The creature’s touch had a dire effect on Kasmira—her vision twisted into horrific images, and she felt as though she were trapped in a nightmare, her body weakened by an overwhelming fatigue. The creature at the back of the room gestured at her and confusion gripped her; she struggled to distinguish friend from foe.</p>  

				<p>Red, seeing the danger, cast a spell that forced one of the ghostly creatures into a solid form, making it vulnerable to their attacks. Varen and Kasmira both opened fire, Kasmira's shots erratic in her confused state. Varen’s musket balls tore into the creature at the back, drawing its attention. In an instant, the two that had been attacking disappeared, only to reappear next to Varen, striking out viciously. Red turned to help, casting another spell to solidify one of the creatures. Varen stepped back, raised his musket, and unleashed a full volley, dispersing the shadowy form in a flash of dark mist.</p>  

				<p>Suddenly, Kasmira, lost in her confusion, turned her pistol on Red, the bullet striking him before she realized what she had done. Ignoring his wound, Red swung his axe at the remaining creature, nearly cleaving it in two. Varen finished it off with a final shot, and as the last of the nightmare creatures dissolved, Red and Varen rushed to calm Kasmira, assuring her that the fight was over. Her eyes cleared, and she looked around, her face pale as she realized what had happened. Together, they stepped outside and found Finn, bringing him back to his senses.</p>  

				<p>Determined to press on, the group entered the next building, which appeared to be a ruined temple. A golden symbol of Aroden hung from the ceiling, tarnished but still gleaming in the dim light. As they moved closer, the air around them seemed to shimmer, and suddenly they were surrounded—spiders, flickering in and out of visibility, phased between the material plane and somewhere else entirely. The spiders struck swiftly, biting before disappearing again, leaving the crew with only moments to react.</p>  

				<p>Red kept his head, preparing a spell as he watched the creatures phase in and out. The moment one reappeared, he cast his spell, anchoring it to their plane. Varen turned, his musket roaring as he fired a volley of bullets, killing the spider instantly. Using the same tactic, they brought down two more, Varen’s bullets and Red’s axe striking true. Finn’s telekinetic weapons slashed through another, and Kasmira’s pistol finished off one more. Finally, Varen’s musket barked once more, ending the last of the threat.</p>  

				<p>The crew paused, catching their breath. The ruins were proving to be more dangerous than they had imagined, but they couldn’t afford to turn back now. The island had to be tamed, its secrets unearthed, if they were ever to call it their own. And somewhere, deep within these haunted grounds, lay the answers they sought—the key to breaking the curse of the Island of Empty Eyes.</p>

				<h2>The Echoes of the Dreamstone</h2>  
				<h3>September 14, 2024</h3>  
				<img src="images/bikendi_otongu.jpg" alt="The ghost of Bikendi Otongu begs the adventurers to help release him." class="left">
				<p>The crew of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> pushed on through the ruins, determined to explore every corner of the cursed island. Moving around the courtyard of the crumbling fort, they found several buildings empty, except for a forge that held two sets of tools they knew would be useful in the days to come. But as they approached the next building—an old structure partially collapsed against the fort's shattered front wall—they found something far more sinister.</p>  

				<p>Inside, six abominations lurked—severed cyclopean hands, grotesquely enlarged and crawling around on their fingertips like monstrous spiders. As the crew opened the door, the hands scurried towards the hole in the front wall and fled. Kasmira, not willing to lose track of them, stepped out to see where they were heading. To her horror, she realized they were looping around to flank them. "They’re going around!" she shouted, but her voice drew their attention. The twisted hands turned, racing toward her.</p>  

				<p>Kasmira braced herself, but she wasn't fast enough. One of the hands lunged, its massive fingers wrapping around her and pinning her to the ground. The rest of the crew rushed to her aid—Varen raised his musket and fired, blasting one of the horrors into pieces. Red swung his axe, cleaving into another, but the wound erupted in a spray of pus that left him doubled over, retching. Finn, seeing Kasmira's plight, unleashed a barrage of telekinetic blasts, while Varen continued to fire into the monstrosities, finally freeing Kasmira from the crushing grasp.</p>  

				<p>With the abominations defeated, the crew regrouped and decided to investigate the large tower looming at the back of the fort. They moved to the double doors, cautiously opening them, but before they could peer inside, a magical alarm rang out, echoing across the ruins. Realizing stealth was no longer an option, they swung the doors wide open and stepped inside. Finn turned invisible, quickly ascending a set of stairs running along the tower’s inner wall, while Kasmira strode into the center of the room, wary of what lay ahead. Varen and Red followed closely behind.</p>  

				<p>Just as Kasmira reached the center of the tower, a massive spider appeared—similar to the ones they had fought before, but with the head of a red-haired human woman. It lunged at Kasmira, biting her before vanishing again. The crew knew this tactic all too well and readied themselves for her next attack. When she reappeared in front of Varen, Red was prepared—he cast a dimensional anchor, pinning her to their plane, while Varen fired his musket. The spider-woman snarled, attempting to grab Varen, but he sidestepped her attack. Red and Finn struck together, axe and telekinetic force flashing in tandem. Varen phased across the room to distance himself, snapping off another shot, while Kasmira leveled her pistol and fired.</p>  

				<p>Badly wounded, the spider-woman tried to flee, scrambling out the double doors and up the wall, but Finn followed her relentlessly, finishing her with a final telekinetic blast. Her twisted form crumpled, and the threat was ended.</p>  

				<p>Further exploring the tower, the crew descended into a dark cellar beneath. An unsettling feeling settled over them, the hairs on their necks standing on end as though unseen eyes were watching. Their search revealed a secret door, hidden within the stone walls. They pushed it open, revealing a hidden room containing several chests and a body lying motionless on the floor.</p>  

				<p>Red moved cautiously to examine the body, but before he could kneel, an apparition materialized before them. "Leave the body alone!" The crew jumped, startled by the ghostly figure’s sudden appearance. "Who are you?" Kasmira demanded, her voice steady despite her racing heart.</p>  

				<p>"My name is Bikendi Otongu," the ghost replied, his spectral form flickering. Recognition dawned on their faces. "Leave my body alone," he repeated, his tone softer, almost pleading.</p>  

				<p>"What are you doing here?" Kasmira asked, her curiosity overcoming her initial shock.</p>  

				<p>Bikendi’s gaze dropped, as if weighed down by regret. "I need your help," he admitted. "I need someone to retrieve the Immortal Dreamstone so that I may finish the ritual and allow my soul to pass on." He spoke of the ritual he had attempted—the ritual interrupted by the cyclops attack that had left him trapped in this ghostly form. "If my soul is to pass on, I need your help."</p>  

				<p>The crew exchanged glances, and Kasmira mentioned their encounter with his apprentice. "Ah, yes, my useless young apprentice," Bikendi said with a hint of disdain. "I've tried to communicate with him, to urge him to retrieve the stone, but he is weak." Kasmira frowned. "You almost drove him mad," she said bluntly.</p>  

				<p>Varen stepped forward, his expression resolute. "We'll retrieve the Dreamstone, and we'll decide what to do with it after that."</p>  

				<p>Hope seemed to flicker in Bikendi's ghostly eyes. "Yes, thank you. I will make a deal—bring me the stone, and I will reveal the location of my other treasures. Speak to Ederleigh—he knows what you need to find it." With that, the ghost faded, leaving them alone in the dim cellar.</p>  

				<p>The crew returned to the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> and spoke with Ederleigh, convincing him to guide them to the Cyclopean ruins known as Sumitha. Ederleigh agreed, though he was visibly nervous, and led them inland, up a massive set of stairs carved for giants, to the top of the island’s central plateau. The ruins loomed ahead, ancient and foreboding.</p>  

				<p>They hadn't traveled far when the ground began to shake, the tremors growing stronger with each passing second. "Something big is coming," Kasmira hissed. "Everyone hide!" But before they could take cover, an immense Titan Centipede burst into view, its countless legs churning as it rolled through the landscape like a living juggernaut.</p>  

				<p>Varen’s eyes narrowed, and he muttered, "This thing can't be allowed to stay on our island." He leveled his musket and fired, the shot striking the creature's chitinous hide. The centipede reared back, letting out a guttural roar that echoed across the plateau before it turned and charged. It rushed toward Varen, a massive, writhing locomotive of legs and rage, trampling him and leaving him sprawled in its wake.</p>  

				<p>The crew leapt into action—Kasmira fired her pistols, Red swung his axe with all his strength, and Finn unleashed a relentless barrage of telekinetic strikes. Their combined assault staggered the creature, giving Varen a chance to rise, dust himself off, and take aim once more. With a single, well-placed shot, he ended the centipede’s rampage, the massive form collapsing with a final, earth-shaking thud.</p>  

				<p>As silence returned to the plateau, the crew exchanged glances, their determination undimmed. The island had many dangers yet to face, but they would not falter. Somewhere within the ruins of Sumitha lay the Dreamstone—and perhaps, the key to freeing the island from its curse.</p>

				<h2>The Assault on Sumitha</h2>  
				<h3>September 21, 2024</h3>  
				<img src="/images/trapper.jpg" alt="The crew of the Scourge's Bane face off against a trapper beast as it tried to eat Kasmira." class="right">
				<p>The crew of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> pressed onward, their determination unwavering as they reached the outskirts of Sumitha, an ancient ruin nestled at the bottom of a valley. Only a single road led into the shattered town, winding through treacherous hills that seemed to close in from all sides. The crew decided to take the road in, advancing cautiously. But before they reached the entrance, a glint of something unnatural caught their eyes—a massive net laid across the road, its ropes leading into the nearby trees.</p>  

				<p>Finn vanished, turning invisible as he and Kasmira moved in to deal with the net. But just as Kasmira began cutting through it, two massive arrows shot from a nearby building, striking her square in the shoulder. She gritted her teeth, and her eyes locked on the source—a hulking cyclops, bow in hand, standing inside a crumbling structure. Without hesitation, the group sprang into action, rushing to her aid. But the cyclops was relentless, drawing and firing another arrow that found its mark.</p>  

				<p>As they approached, the crew realized the cyclops wasn’t alone. More shadows moved within the building, and the giants began retreating further into the shadows. Finn, still invisible, crept into the structure, spotting the cyclops as they slammed shut a heavy door, hiding within. The rest of the group followed in, and Finn flung the door open, revealing their foes. In an instant, Kasmira fired her pistol, her shot echoing through the ruined walls, while Red charged forward, his axe raised high.</p>  

				<p>But the cyclops were ready. Red’s advance was met with a brutal swing of a greatclub that crashed into his head. He staggered, blood streaming down his face, but before he could recover, the cyclops struck again, this time dropping him to the ground—unmoving and not breathing.</p>  

				<p>Finn tumbled past the towering foes, lunging from behind and plunging his weapon deep into one of the cyclops. The brute howled in pain, but there was no time to celebrate as another cyclops moved over Red’s body, swinging its massive club at Kasmira, connecting with a sickening thud. The situation was growing dire. Varen stepped up, his musket aimed, but disaster struck—the weapon jammed at the worst possible moment. He cursed under his breath, quickly drawing a pistol and vanishing from sight.</p>  

				<p>The battle raged on, Finn’s relentless telekinetic strikes bringing down one of the cyclops while Varen’s pistol fired from the shadows. But the cyclops fought like cornered beasts, their clubs crashing down with bone-shattering force. Kasmira was near her breaking point, every breath labored, but she refused to give in. With a fierce yell, she fired again, the bullet piercing her foe’s eye and dropping it where it stood.</p>  

				<p>Varen reappeared, his eyes filled with determination, as he unloaded his pistol into another cyclops. The beast stumbled and fell, and with one final push, Finn took out the last of them. The dust settled, and the crew stood among the fallen giants, battered and bloodied. Kasmira collapsed to her knees, her vision blurring. They had won, but at a terrible cost—Red lay dead at their feet.</p>  

				<p>Without wasting a moment, Varen used his magic to transport them back to the ship. Sandara worked quickly, her hands glowing with divine energy as she brought Red back from the brink, restoring his life and healing the crew’s wounds. They spent the night aboard the <i>Bane</i>, resting, recovering, and gathering their strength for what lay ahead.</p>  

				<p>Determined to press on, the group returned to the ruins the next day. This time, they climbed a hill overlooking the desolate valley below. Kasmira spotted a domed building rising from the hillside, and she decided to scale the structure for a better look. But as she climbed, a cyclops spotted her, loosing an arrow that narrowly missed, clattering against the stone near her. Kasmira called out, offering parley, but the cyclops showed no interest in talking. Varen, ever the sharpshooter, responded with a volley of bullets, dropping one of the giants where it stood.</p>  

				<p>The remaining cyclops retreated, disappearing into a building before emerging on the opposite side, running down the road. They were making their way around the hill, attempting to flank the group. With the cyclops gone for the moment, the crew seized their chance, dropping into the valley below and approaching the domed structure.</p>  

				<p>Kasmira checked a nearby door, her instincts sharp. Finding it safe, she slowly opened it, but the old metal groaned loudly, the sound echoing across the ruins. The crew froze, holding their breath, but when no immediate danger appeared, they stepped inside. The first two rooms they found were large and empty, untouched for decades. But the back of the second room opened into a natural cave-like passageway, leading to a foul-smelling chamber with a large pool of stagnant water.</p>  

				<p>At the edge of the pool, something glinted—a short sword, its blade pristine. Kasmira’s eyes narrowed, and she moved to investigate. Red held up a hand, his eyes closing as he concentrated. "The sword is magic," he exclaimed. Kasmira nodded, slipping into the room carefully. She hadn’t gone more than fifteen feet when the floor beneath her erupted, folding around her like a monstrous blanket. The creature, a giant trapper, had been lying in wait, blending perfectly with the stone. Its leathery body enveloped her, crushing her in a deadly embrace.</p>  

				<p>Red rushed forward, his greataxe biting into the creature’s hide, while Kasmira fired her pistol from within, the muzzle flash lighting up the dark interior of the beast. Varen fired his musket, the shot echoing through the chamber, but the trapper refused to release its hold. It squeezed tighter, its body slamming Red aside as he tried to free his captain. In response, Red roared, swinging his axe with all his might, the blade cutting deep. The trapper shuddered, releasing Kasmira in its desperation to flee.</p>  

				<p>But Kasmira wasn’t about to let it escape. She rose, her eyes filled with fury, and took aim. "Not today," she growled, pulling the trigger. The shot rang out, and the trapper fell, its body slumping to the ground as the light faded from its eyes.</p>  

				<p>The crew stood in the aftermath, their breaths ragged, their bodies weary. The ruins of Sumitha held secrets yet to be uncovered, dangers still lurking in the shadows. But they had come too far to turn back now. Somewhere in these haunted halls lay the Immortal Dreamstone—the key to freeing this island from its curse. And they would stop at nothing to claim it.</p>

				<p>But as they turned to leave, a cold wind swept through the chamber, and an eerie whisper seemed to echo from the darkness, just on the edge of perceptions. Was it their imagination? Looks of detemination etched on their faces, they pressed foward into the darkness.</p>
