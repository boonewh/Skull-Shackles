				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					In January 1986 a group met for the first time to play a session of Dungeons & Dragons. 
					Out of the five people at that session, two them are in the group today, 37 years later. 
				</p>
		
				<p>
					At about the same time, two other members of this group were having regular games with 
					friends from school. 
				</p>
		
				<p>
					These four people would eventually all meet and begin playing regular Dungeons & Dragons sessions
					together. Through the years there have been many others who have come and gone, but we 
					remember them all. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Our group has known each other for a long time. Even the newest members have known 
					one of our members for many years. We've been together 
					through good and bad. Marriages, a divorce, job changes, and more. As I said, the group has lost some
					members through the years who we miss, but the current group has become close. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					We've played so many editions of different games through the years. D&D 1st edition, 2nd, 3rd,
					3.5. It was only when we hit 4th edition, and couldn't stomach the rot, that we had to go a 
					different direction. One of our new members back then, still with us 15 years later, offered 
					to be the storyteller for a game most of us had never heard of: Pathfinder. In reality it was 
					mostly the game that we had been playing for the past several years, a version of D&D 3.5, 
					so naturally we loved it. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					As we've continued playing Pathfinder, we've decided to stick to the adventure paths and share
					storytelling duties. Currently three of us take turns running an adventure. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					If you look at our house rules and ask &#8220why?&#8221 on anything, know that we discussed our house rules
					before implementing any of them and came to a consensus. We have tweaked the game to be what
					we want to play, what we love. And that's the point, isn't it?
