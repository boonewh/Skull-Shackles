                <h2>December 31, 2024</h2>
                <h3>Storm on the Horizon</h3>
                <img src="images/storm_brewing.jpg" alt="A storm brewing over the Shackles and the Pirate's Council meets" class="left">
                <p>The smell of blood and spells still lingered in the air as the officers of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> surveyed their grim prize. The storm of battle had passed, but the true tempest loomed ahead. Blood and smoke marked their victory, but what they uncovered within the crumbling stronghold promised no respite.</p>

                <p>Their search through the fort revealed treasures, plunder, and hidden compartments. Yet it was not the gold nor the rare trinkets that chilled them—it was the papers. Letters sealed with the infernal red of Cheliax, bearing the unmistakable hand of Admiral Thrune herself. Varen spread the documents across a cracked wooden table, reading aloud the damning words.</p>

                <p>"Harrigan was the traitor," he murmured, his voice taut with disbelief. "Thrune’s puppet. The staged raids, the captured ships, all orchestrated to bolster Cheliax’s might in the Shackles." He let the final page fall, his piercing gaze meeting Kasmira’s. "And we were his primary target. Stealing the <i>Wormwood</i> painted a bullseye on our backs."</p>

                <p>Finn let out a low whistle. "So much for retiring to a quiet port."</p>

                <p>"Retire?" Red grunted, hefting his axe over one shoulder. "Not until we’ve buried this entire Chelish armada."</p>

                <p>Their exploration unearthed one more enigma—a basin of clear, still water etched with arcane symbols. Varen’s sharp eyes narrowed as he examined it. “A scrying font,” he said, awe and caution mingling in his voice. Before the others could respond, the water stirred, spiraling upward. A figure emerged, her image forming in cruel clarity.</p>

                <p>Admiral Thrune stood before them, her Chelish navy uniform crisp, her smile as sharp as the daggers concealed within her words. "So, these are the pests that have gnawed at Harrigan’s leash," she sneered. "Submit to Thrune, and perhaps I’ll find use for you. Refuse, and you’ll sink with the rest of the Shackles."</p>

                <p>Finn smirked. "Pests? I’ve been called worse by better."</p>

                <p>But Thrune’s laughter echoed, cold as iron chains, before the water exploded in a surge of magical energy. The basin shattered, leaving only silence and the stench of ozone. Kasmira wiped debris from her coat, one eyebrow arched. "What the hell was that?"</p>

                <p>"A message," Varen replied grimly. "And a declaration of war."</p>

                <p>The officers wasted no time. With the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> and the captured <i>Wormwood</i> left to secure the fort, Varen gathered his companions. A few whispered incantations later, they stood before the grand villa of Tessa Fairwind in Quent. Tessa greeted them with a mix of curiosity and concern, her sharp eyes sweeping over their battle-worn forms.</p>

                <p>After Kasmira recounted the events at Gannet Island, including the ominous encounter with Thrune, Tessa’s expression darkened. "We need to call an emergency council," she said, her voice steady despite the weight of her words. "The Free Captains must hear this."</p>

                <p>Varen’s magic whisked them to Port Peril, where they sought an audience with the Hurricane King himself, Kerdak Bonefist. The wait was interminable, their frustration mounting as the minutes crawled by. When finally admitted, their arguments and evidence were met with Kerdak’s stony indifference.</p>

                <p>"And how do I know this isn’t fabricated?" he growled, dismissing the damning letters with a wave of his hand. "You defeated Harrigan. Why sully his name further?"</p>

                <p>Kasmira’s fury ignited. "You call this slander?" she spat. "Harrigan’s whip scars our backs—ask anyone here! These plans are real, and if you ignore them, you’ll doom the Shackles!"</p>

                <p>Kerdak’s expression remained impassive. "The Eye of Abendego will tear their fleet to shreds before they reach us. We’ll defend our ports and destroy what’s left."</p>

                <p>"They’re already through the Eye," Kasmira countered. But the Hurricane King’s mind was set. With a final dismissive gesture, he left, leaving the companions seething.</p>

                <p>The following week dragged on as the Free Captains trickled into Port Peril. When the council finally convened, Kerdak repeated his stance, his voice rising above the protests. "Meeting the Chelish fleet in open waters is suicide! We’ll defend our ports, and that is final. Anyone who sails out to meet this fleet should be considered a traitor!"</p>

                <p>But the murmurs of dissent began to swell, captains questioning Kerdak’s resolve. Kasmira seized the moment, her voice cutting through the discontent. "If Kerdak won’t act, someone must. The Chelish fleet won’t wait, and neither can we."</p>

                <p>Tessa Fairwind stepped forward, her gaze blazing with determination. "I’ll follow you, Kasmira. I’ll pledge my ships to your cause. And if you succeed, I’ll support a claim for any one of you to seize the Hurricane Crown."</p>

                <p>One by one, the voices of support rose. Arronax Endymion pledged his fleet, his booming voice a rallying cry. The Master of Gales, though weary, vowed to stand by their side. The tide had turned, and the companions were no longer isolated rebels—they were leaders of a growing resistance.</p>

                <p>As the hall buzzed with urgency, Kasmira turned to her companions, her resolve hard as steel. "Get your ships ready. We sail to hunt a Chelish armada."</p>

                <p>Outside, the winds howled like the roar of an angry sea, as if the Shackles themselves knew the storm that was coming.</p>
