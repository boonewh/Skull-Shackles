                <h2>Claiming the Island of Empty Eyes</h2>  
				<h3>August 31, 2024</h3>  
				<img src="images/phantasms.jpg" alt="Undead rise at night to wander a delapidated fort near the shore with a ship moored in the background" class="left">
				<p>After their triumphant victory in the Captain’s Regatta, the crew of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> sailed back to Port Peril. Their legend had already outpaced them, spreading through the taverns and streets like wildfire. Tales of their daring exploits echoed from every corner, and the officers found themselves the subject of countless songs and toasts. In every inn, tankards were raised in their honor, their drinks paid for by admirers and fellow captains. Their friends and allies congratulated them heartily, but it was the invitation to a feast hosted by the Pirate Council itself that truly marked their place in the Shackles' history.</p>  

				<p>As the celebration raged, the Master of the Gales pulled the officers aside. “Your prize,” he said, his voice low and serious, “is an island. North of the Rampore Isles, in a remote archipelago. It’s called the Island of Empty Eyes, named for the strange statues that stare out over its shores. The island is yours—but don’t expect it to be an easy conquest.” He glanced at each of them in turn, his eyes like ice. “There are dangers on that island. If you want to claim it and take your place on the Pirate Council, you’ll need to tame it. In three months’ time, the Council will visit to see if you’re fit for the honor. You’ll be expected to host them, as lords of the Shackles deserve. If you succeed, they’ll take your oath of loyalty and give you your seat on the Council. If not… you won’t be the first Regatta champion to fail.”</p>  

				<p>The officers of the <i>Bane</i> exchanged determined glances. They knew the legends of the Island of Empty Eyes. They would claim it—or die trying.</p>  

				<p>The very next morning, they set sail for their new domain. Arriving at the island, Varen scanned the coastline from the crow’s nest. After some discussion, they decided against the larger coves and guided the <i>Bane</i> into a small, protected bay in the southeast. The closer they got, the thicker the seaweed became, clogging the waters and emitting a strange, foul smell.</p>  

				<p>Suddenly, Kasmira’s voice rang out. “Treasure! I see something in the seaweed—looks like a chest!” She insisted they investigate, and soon the officers were in a small boat, rowing toward the suspicious object. As they neared, the seaweed itself erupted into life, lashing out with vine-like tendrils. Varen and Owlbear were caught in its writhing grasp, and Varen’s cutlass did little to free him.</p>  

				<p>Red’s axe barely scratched the creature, but Kasmira’s bullets tore through it. Varen, thinking quickly, phased out of the creature’s hold and reappeared with his musket. His shots ripped into the creature, and soon Kasmira and Varen’s combined firepower brought it down. The seaweed slumped into the water, dead—the “treasure” had been nothing more than a lure.</p>  

				<p>Undeterred, the officers rowed ashore and began exploring their new home. As they walked along the beach, they heard an ethereal singing drifting through the rocks. Following the sound, they came upon a grotto with crystal-clear water—and a woman, or rather, a fey, bathing within. She rose from the water, smiling warmly. Introducing herself as Sefina, she explained that she had made the island her home long ago and welcomed them as its new masters. Though wary, the crew found her to be genuine, and after some conversation, they bid her farewell, promising to speak again soon.</p>  

				<p>Continuing their exploration, they reached the largest cove, where a waterfall split the beach. On the far side, they spotted a dilapidated fort, its walls crumbling but still standing. Kasmira, eager to investigate, used her magic tricorne to conjure a boat, and the group set off across the waters.</p>  

				<p>Halfway across, disaster struck. Tentacles as thick as tree trunks burst from the depths—a massive octopus had been lurking below, waiting for prey. The creature’s limbs wrapped around the boat, lifting the officers into the air. Red quickly cast a spell to protect the group, while Kasmira fired her pistol into the writhing tentacles. Varen, his eyes glowing with dark energy, drained the life from the beast even as it pulled them into the water.</p>  

				<p>The octopus dragged Kasmira toward its massive maw, ready to bite down, but she pressed her pistol to its flesh and fired, the shot echoing through the water. The octopus shuddered, then went still, releasing its grip as it sank back into the depths. The crew, wet and bruised, hauled themselves back into the boat and continued toward the fort.</p>  

				<p>Entering through the shattered gates, they found the fort in ruins, but still salvageable. This could be their new home—if they could survive its dangers. Inside the first building, they were immediately struck by a wave of fear so intense that Owlbear fled in terror. The others, though shaken, held their ground as a dark, nightmarish figure emerged from the shadows.</p>  

				<p>They fought back, but their weapons did little to harm the creature. It wasn’t until Red cast a spell that solidified the swirling shadows that they were able to land any meaningful blows. With renewed vigor, they destroyed the creature, but it had cost them dearly.</p>  

				<p>Upstairs, the fort was riddled with traps. Each room they entered seemed more dangerous than the last. Finally, they reached a corner room, where a voice shouted from within. “Go away! Leave me alone!” Kasmira picked the lock and opened the door, revealing a man huddled in the top corner of the room—his back pressed against the ceiling. His eyes were wild with madness, and no amount of soothing words from Kasmira could calm him. At one point, he even screamed, “Get out of my head!” and triggered an electrical trap, nearly frying Kasmira.</p>  

				<p>Reluctant to harm the man, and with night falling, they decided to leave him be for now, hoping if they brought Sandara, she could heal his mind later. Red flew back to the ship to move it to the large cove, where they could anchor for the night.</p>  

				<p>That decision may have saved their lives. As darkness fell over the island, a thick mist rose from the ground. Lights appeared in the towers of the fort, casting an eerie glow over the courtyard. The crew watched in horror as undead figures began to shuffle through the fort, their rotting eyes turning toward the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i>. They walked into the water, glaring at the ship with malice, their decaying flesh hanging from their bones.</p>  

				<p>As the mist thickened and the dead crept ever closer, their hollow eyes gleaming with malice, one truth became chillingly clear—their island was not just dangerous. It was cursed. And the horrors that waited in the darkness were only beginning to stir.</p>

				<h2>The Ghosts of Empty Eyes</h2>  
				<h3>September 7, 2024</h3>  
				<img src="images/the_temple.jpg" alt="Nightmare creatures attack in the ruined temple." class="right">
				<p>The morning after a harrowing night of haunting visions and ghostly threats, the crew of the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> steeled themselves to confront the madness they had left behind. They returned to the room where they had found Ederleigh Baines, once again navigating through the treacherous traps that had been reset. The unsettling sense of being watched weighed heavily on them as they made their way through the top floor, reaching the room where Baines had been hiding.</p>  

				<p>They found him just as they had left—raving, eyes wild with fear, clinging to the ceiling in the room's corner like a cornered animal. "Leave me alone! Get out of my head!" he screamed, his voice cracking. Finn attempted to fly up, hoping to bring Baines down so Sandara could attempt a healing spell, but Baines lashed out in panic, triggering another trap that blasted Finn with electricity. Varen, reacting swiftly, cast a spell that wove a web through the room, hoping to keep Baines in place. The magical strands caught the crazed man, and Finn managed to maneuver through the sticky threads to reach him.</p>  

				<p>With effort, Finn pinned Baines against the ceiling, but he couldn't drag him down alone. Varen cast a spell that enlarged Sandara, making her as large as a giant. With newfound strength, Sandara reached up, her hand gently touching Baines even as he flinched away. Her spell of healing coursed through him, and slowly, the madness in his eyes began to fade. He blinked, confused, his gaze shifting around the room as if seeing it for the first time. Kasmira spoke softly, drawing him back to reality and easing him down from his heightened state of fear.</p>  

				<p>Ederleigh finally began to speak, his voice trembling but coherent. He explained that he had come to the island with his master, Bikendi Otongu, a Mwangi wizard. The wizard had brought him and a pirate crew to the island to enact a ritual—something involving his soul passing into the realm of dreams. But before the ritual could be completed, Cyclopes attacked, killing the crew and seemingly Bikendi himself. Yet Baines knew his master’s spirit still haunted the island, tormenting him night after night, driving him to the brink of madness.</p>  

				<p>Kasmira asked if Baines would be willing to help them explore the island, to reclaim it from whatever horrors still lurked there. He agreed, on one condition—if they left, they would take him with them. He had no wish to stay on this cursed island a moment longer than necessary.</p>  

				<p>The group sent Ederleigh back to the <i>Scourge’s Bane</i> with Sandara to begin his recovery while they pressed on, determined to explore the fort’s ruins. The next building appeared to be an old mess hall, but as they stepped inside, Kasmira suddenly heard a voice whisper in her mind. "Where is the dreamstone?" it demanded. "I don’t know what you are talking about," she answered aloud, glancing at her companions, her expression wary. "Where is the dreamstone? What have you done with it?" the voice persisted, more insistent.</p>  

				<p>Before she could answer again, three shadowy forms materialized, their bodies swirling like living nightmares. They resembled the creature they had faced the previous day before found Baines, and their presence filled the air with a tangible sense of dread. Finn was immediately overcome by their dark magic, his eyes wide with terror as he turned and fled from the room.</p>  

				<p>Two of the creatures moved in on Kasmira and Red, while the third lingered behind, its eyes fixed on them with an unnatural hatred. The creature’s touch had a dire effect on Kasmira—her vision twisted into horrific images, and she felt as though she were trapped in a nightmare, her body weakened by an overwhelming fatigue. The creature at the back of the room gestured at her and confusion gripped her; she struggled to distinguish friend from foe.</p>  

				<p>Red, seeing the danger, cast a spell that forced one of the ghostly creatures into a solid form, making it vulnerable to their attacks. Varen and Kasmira both opened fire, Kasmira's shots erratic in her confused state. Varen’s musket balls tore into the creature at the back, drawing its attention. In an instant, the two that had been attacking disappeared, only to reappear next to Varen, striking out viciously. Red turned to help, casting another spell to solidify one of the creatures. Varen stepped back, raised his musket, and unleashed a full volley, dispersing the shadowy form in a flash of dark mist.</p>  

				<p>Suddenly, Kasmira, lost in her confusion, turned her pistol on Red, the bullet striking him before she realized what she had done. Ignoring his wound, Red swung his axe at the remaining creature, nearly cleaving it in two. Varen finished it off with a final shot, and as the last of the nightmare creatures dissolved, Red and Varen rushed to calm Kasmira, assuring her that the fight was over. Her eyes cleared, and she looked around, her face pale as she realized what had happened. Together, they stepped outside and found Finn, bringing him back to his senses.</p>  

				<p>Determined to press on, the group entered the next building, which appeared to be a ruined temple. A golden symbol of Aroden hung from the ceiling, tarnished but still gleaming in the dim light. As they moved closer, the air around them seemed to shimmer, and suddenly they were surrounded—spiders, flickering in and out of visibility, phased between the material plane and somewhere else entirely. The spiders struck swiftly, biting before disappearing again, leaving the crew with only moments to react.</p>  

				<p>Red kept his head, preparing a spell as he watched the creatures phase in and out. The moment one reappeared, he cast his spell, anchoring it to their plane. Varen turned, his musket roaring as he fired a volley of bullets, killing the spider instantly. Using the same tactic, they brought down two more, Varen’s bullets and Red’s axe striking true. Finn’s telekinetic weapons slashed through another, and Kasmira’s pistol finished off one more. Finally, Varen’s musket barked once more, ending the last of the threat.</p>  

				<p>The crew paused, catching their breath. The ruins were proving to be more dangerous than they had imagined, but they couldn’t afford to turn back now. The island had to be tamed, its secrets unearthed, if they were ever to call it their own. And somewhere, deep within these haunted grounds, lay the answers they sought—the key to breaking the curse of the Island of Empty Eyes.</p>
